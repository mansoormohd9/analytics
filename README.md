Demo Available at https://analytics-ui-demo.herokuapp.com/

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn lint
```

### Completed
```
Most of the requirement shared has been done apart from few missing css stylings
```

### Not completed
```
I think tests cases is something that would be good to add to make this complete but given I have assigned myself a constrained time I wasn't able to do that
```

### Known Bugs and Limitations
```
- Width and height of departments are being computed dynamically but there is a limitation that this doesn't occupy the complete available div
- Few icons and stylings are not as per the image shared and css can be improved further
```
